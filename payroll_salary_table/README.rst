Salary Tables to be used on payroll calculation.

Set values for applicable for certain master data values, or even for
combinations on them. These can thn be read from salary rules, to have
those values applied to employees that natch those conditions.

Examples include:

-  Income Tax Deduction Rate, based on the employee's Income Tax
   Position and total income amount.

-  Base Salary, based on a combination of Professional category and Pay
   Grade.

Configuration
=============

At Payroll / Configuration / Salary Tables, define the different salary
tables to use.

Examples of Salary Tables include:

-  Basic Salary per Professional Category, or Pay Grade, or both.
-  Tax Rates per Tax Situation and taxable amount.
-  Allowance amounts or rates per Professional Category, or other
   relevant data.

To create a Salary Table provide:

-  Name: a meaningful title.
-  Code: an identifier used to reference it from salary rules.
-  Sequence: the order of value application, larger numbers override
   lower numbers.
-  Type 1, 2, 3: select the Master Data Types to use to match table
   values.

Usage
=====

Salary Tables are maintained at Payroll / Configuration / Salary Tables.
Create a Salary Table Period to create a table valid for a specific
period.

On a Salary Table Period set:

-  Template: the salary table being used
-  Company : the company it applies to (all if left empty)
-  Start and End Dates: the validity period (optional)
-  Note: any comment and notes
-  Lines: enter each combination and the Result value to be used when
   matched

Salary Tables can accessed in salary rules using the lookup_tables
function. Examples:

::

   value = lookup_tables("BASIC")
   rate = lookup_tables("TAX", taxable_amount)

Master Data values can be accessed in salary rules using the
get_data_value function. Examples:

::

   result = contract.get_data_value("BASIC")
   result_data = contract.get_data_value("TAX_SITUATION")

Payslip lines can store a Master Data value returned by a salary rule in
the ``result_data`` variable. This can be useful for audit and
reporting.
