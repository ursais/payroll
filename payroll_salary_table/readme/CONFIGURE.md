At Payroll / Configuration / Salary Tables, define the different salary tables to use.

Examples of Salary Tables include:

- Basic Salary per Professional Category, or Pay Grade, or both.
- Tax Rates per Tax Situation and taxable amount.
- Allowance amounts or rates per Professional Category, or other relevant data.

To create a Salary Table provide:

- Name: a meaningful title.
- Code: an identifier used to reference it from salary rules.
- Sequence: the order of value application, larger numbers override lower numbers.
- Type 1, 2, 3: select the Master Data Types to use to match table values.
